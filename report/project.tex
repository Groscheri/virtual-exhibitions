  \section{Introduction}
  % TODO describe aim of the project
  % TODO describe briefly different tasks
  
  This project deals with \textbf{Agent Oriented Software Engineering} (AOSE) in the 
  context of a virtual exhibitions (smart museum). The aim is to model a multi-agent 
  system with specific methods of modelisation: GAIA and Role-base modeling.
  As a consequence of the previous works, this project reuses concepts we learnt 
  during lectures and homeworks: behaviors, messaging, negotiation, mobility, ...

  \section{GAIA Methodology} % task 1
  % Model your system via GAIA AOSE Methodology
  % Agent Oriented Sofware Engineering (AOSE)
  
  \subsection{Requirements statement}
  % TODO text describing the scenario
  
  In the smart museum scenario, we have different actors: artist managers, curators 
  and profilers. Each actor interacts with each other and has different tasks to 
  perform.
  
  Firstly, artist manager is responsible to gather paintings or art creations 
  from a set of different artists he or she is in contact with. The goal of the manager 
  is to sell products with different quality level to profilers.
  
  In order to sell paintings to profilers, artist manager has to use curators as retailers 
  because they don't know profilers directly. Thus, they have to provide products with an 
  announced price to curators which will be responsible to sell it to profilers. Because there 
  are several curators and only one curator can retail one product, curators have to come and 
  visit artist manager in order to perform a Dutch auction. This auction will determine which 
  curator will be asked to retail the product.
  
  Finally, Profiler can explore different products offered by curators and tell whether he or 
  she wants to buy the product at the displayed price.
  
  % TODO put schemes (the one in instructions ?)
  
  \subsection{Roles model}
  % TODO tables
  
  Different roles can be modeled in our scenario:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Artist Manager role (described in Figure~\ref{figure:role_artist_manager})
   \item Curator role (described in Figure~) % TODO
   \item Profiler role (described in Figure~) % TODO
