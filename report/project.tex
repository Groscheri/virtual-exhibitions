  \section{Introduction}
  % TODO describe aim of the project
  % TODO describe briefly different tasks
  
  This project deals with \textbf{Agent Oriented Software Engineering} (AOSE) in the 
  context of a virtual exhibitions (smart museum). The aim is to model a multi-agent 
  system with specific methods of modelisation: GAIA and Role-base modeling.
  As a consequence of the previous works, this project reuses concepts we learnt 
  during lectures and homeworks: behaviors, messaging, negotiation, mobility, ...

  \section{GAIA Methodology} % task 1
  % Model your system via GAIA AOSE Methodology
  % Agent Oriented Sofware Engineering (AOSE)
  
  \subsection{Requirements statement}
  % TODO text describing the scenario
  
  In the smart museum scenario, we have different actors: artist managers, curators 
  and profilers.
  
  Firstly, the artist manager is responsible to gather paintings or art creations 
  from a set of different artists he or she is in contact with. The goal of the manager 
  is to sell products with different quality level to profilers.
  
  In order to sell paintings to profilers, the artist manager has to use curators as retailers 
  because they don't know profilers directly. The curators are associated to a museum and there
  is only one for each museum. In our model we have 2 museums and consequently 2 curators. The artist manager 
  provides a product with an announced price to curators who will afterwards
  sell it to profilers. Because there are 2 curators and only one of them can buy 
  the product, curators have to visit the artist manager in order to take part in a Dutch auction. 
  This auction will determine which curator gets the product.
  
  Finally, the profiler receives suggestions of products offered by curators and can choose whether he or 
  she wants to buy the product at the displayed price or not.

  \subsection{Interaction Model}
  % ArtistManager -> Curators: DutchAuction
  % Curators -> Profiler: proposeProduct, waitResponse
  % Profiler -> Curator: waitOffer, buyProduct, rejectProduct

  The 3 roles of our model interact with each other through protocols. Artist Manager 
  communicates with Curators thanks to Dutch Auction Protocol (see Table~\ref{table:dutch_auction_protocol}). 
  Curators communicate with Profiler with 2 different protocols: Propose Product 
  Protocol (Table~\ref{table:propose_product_protocol}) and Wait Response Protocol (see Table~\ref{table:wait_response_protocol}). 
  Finally, Profiler interacts with Curators through 3 different protocols: Wait Offer Protocol (see Table~\ref{table:wait_offer_protocol}), 
  Buy Product Protocol (see Table~\ref{table:buy_product_protocol}) and Reject Product Protocol (see Table~\ref{table:reject_product_protocol}).

  % d. Identification of the travel path of each mobile agent

  \subsubsection{Place types}
    In the scenario, there are 4 places described in more details in Table~\ref{table:mobility_places}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0pt
   \item 2 museums: Museo Galileo \& Museo Heritage Malta
   \item 1 house (corresponding to the mobile application)
   \item 1 office (corresponding to the Artist Manager's office)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{table}[ht!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|C{0.75}|L{1.5}|C{0.75}|}
   \thead{Place Types} & \thead{Description} & \thead{Instances} \\ \hline \hline
   Office & Place where it is possible to work & 1 \\\hline
   Museum & Place which contains exhibitions of paintings \& art & 2\\\hline
   House & Place where it is possible to live & 1 \\\hline
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Place types}
  \label{table:mobility_places}
  \end{table}
  
  \subsubsection{Relationships}
  Only Curator agents are given mobility as described in Table~\ref{table:mobility_relationships}. They are able to move to different places: House and Office.
   \begin{table}[ht!]
   \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
   \thead{Agent Types} & \thead{Mobile} & \thead{Place types} & \thead{Constraints} \\ \hline \hline
   ArtistManager &  & Office & -\\\hline
   Curator & \checkmark & Museum, Office \& House & -\\\hline

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Relationships between agent types and place types}
  \label{table:mobility_relationships}
  \end{table}
  
  \subsubsection{Cardinality}
  
  Since Curator agents have the ability to move from their museum place 
  to other places, it is possible to find Curator agents everywhere. On 
  the contrary, because ArtistManager agent and Profiler agent are statics, 
  it is not possible to find them anywhere else than in their place. It is 
  important to notice that both Curator agents can't be in the same museum at 
  the same time. They are assigned to one museum and visiting the fellow museum 
  is not allowed. All cardinalities are exposed in Figure~\ref{figure:mobility_cardinality}.
  
  \tikzstyle{custom_circle} = [draw, circle, minimum size=.5cm]
  
  \begin{figure}[ht!]

   \caption{Cardinality of each association agent-place}
   \label{figure:mobility_cardinality}
  \end{figure}

  
  \subsubsection{Travel paths}
  The only Agent that performs mobility is the Curator. It moves from the museum
  to the office in order to participate at a Dutch action and afterwards, he or she
  goes from the museum to the house of the profiler in order to sell a painting.
  For both travel paths, we have only one atomic movement. Consequently:\\
  Origin: \textit{Museum}\\
  Destination: \textit{Office}\\
  Movement ID: museumOffice - atomic movement from the museum to the office\\
  Path ID: museumOffice\\
  
  Origin: \textit{Museum}\\
  Destination: \textit{Home}\\
  Movement ID: museumHome - atomic movement from the museum to the home of the profiler\\
  Path ID: museumHome

  In order to realize use cases diagrams, it was to necessary to find out each actor 
  of the scenario. The granularity of actors has been reduced compared to GAIA analysis 
  due to ``atomicness'' of RoMAS method. Use cases are described in Figure~\ref{figure:use_cases}.

  \subsubsection{Roles}
  % (2) Identify roles from use cases;
  % Goals / Attributes / Services (methods)
  
  Use cases allow us to identify each role. Each role has a goal, a set of attributes 
  and a set of services. Following paragraphs describe all of them.
  
  % Roles:
  % - Product chooser : product list / getHighQuality / getLowQuality
  % - Auctioneer (DutchAuction) : call for proposal (price) / accept / refuse
  % - Bidder (DutchAuction) : propose / bid
  % - Strategist : strategy list / choose strategy / define new price
  % - Proposer : propose offer
  % - Decision maker: budget / define budget / choose action(proposal)
  % - Buyer : buy product
  % - Rejecter : reject product
  % - Revealer : reveal quality
  % - Mover : move to house / move to office / move to museum

  It is possible to aggregate and gather some roles (previously defined) together. Among all 
  of them, 3 main roles appear: \textbf{Artist Manager}, \textbf{Curator} and \textbf{Profiler}. 
  Figure~\ref{figure:role_organization} displays roles organization in smart museum scenario.

  \subsection{Comparison with GAIA}
  % TODO Task 4.2 Comment on differences in resulting
  %               designs of 4.1 and GAIA (from Task 1).
  % (i.e. Analysis phase of GAIA against performing 
  %  role-based modeling as first step to GAIA analysis)

  Compared to GAIA analysis, role-based modeling (RoMAS) allows dynamic roles 
  for each agent. Based on use cases and actors, it is possible to find out 
  roles in the system. GAIA, on the other hand doesn't provide such method and 
  it goes first in roles definition with 4 different characteristics: responsibilities, 
  permissions, protocols and activities. RoMAS also produces organizational 
  diagram in order to outline roles interactions while GAIA asks for an acquaintance 
  model. Roles are seen as states where it is possible to perform actions (like 
  behaviors in JADE framework) in role-based modeling. As a result, roles are more 
  atomic in RoMAS method than with GAIA analysis which goes deeper in the details with 
  concepts such as protocols and activities. These concepts are very close (if not 
  similar) to the behavior concept.
  
  It is also important to notice that RoMAS doesn't have any method to deal with mobility 
  and it has to be considered as a role. Notions like places and relationships between 
  agents and places don't exist neither.
  
  % TODO well ? :p
  Finally, RoMAS is at MAS analysis methods what Ruby is at Object Oriented Programing 
  languages: ``Everything is role''
